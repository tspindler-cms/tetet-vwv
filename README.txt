Known Limitations
=================

CVA-31 Bon Homme Richard
    - Player controlled helicopters slightly move forward on the flight deck
F-8 Crusader
    - Aircraft is intended as static and for limited AI operations
    - Player control is experimental at best, but largely untested and unsupported
    - Carrier launch and landing operations are not supported for player aircraft, only AI
    - Unknown how to drop bombs as player aircraft
    - Variable incidence wing is not enabled
    - Collision shell not reliable under player control
    - Nose wheel rotation disabled
MiG-17F "Fresco-C"
    - Player control is almost untested and unsupported
    - Collision shell not reliable under player control
    - Damage suspectible when placed as static
MiG-21MF "Fishbed-J"
    - Gear up location is pretty bad
H-2 Seasprite
    - Wheels don't touch the ship deck
Fletcher Class Destroyers with FRAM II upgrade
    - Bridge and mast are WWII style

    - 20mm Oerlikons have no firing sound
RA-5C Vigilante
    - The plane is too large for regular parking spots, best to use as single plane on the runway

MiG-21MF "Fishbed-C"
    - Textures are work in progress
