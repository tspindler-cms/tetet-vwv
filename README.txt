Vietnam War Vessels by TeTeT

A first pre-release of Vietnam War Vessels contains two participants in the Gulf of Tonkin incident:

P 4 Class Torpedo Boat
USS Maddox (DD-731), Sumner class destroyer

This is my first attempt at modding for DCS, so take the results with a grain of salt.

How to install

The mods directory needs to go into your Saved Games DCS folder.
