Vietnam War Vessels by TeTeT
0.3.0

This release of Vietnam War Vessels contains two participants in the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and an aircraft carrier, and a plane:

P 4 class torpedo boat
USS Maddox (DD-731), Sumner class destroyer
USS Bon Homme Richard (CVA-31), Essex class carrier
F-8 Crusader, a supersonic fighter jet

This is my first attempt at modding for DCS, so take the results with a grain of salt.

How to install

The mods directory needs to go into your Saved Games DCS folder.

Known Limitations

CVA-31 Bon Homme Richard
    - Player controlled helicopters slightly move forward on the flight deck

    - Unknown how to drop bombs as player aircraft
    - Variable incidence wing is not enabled
