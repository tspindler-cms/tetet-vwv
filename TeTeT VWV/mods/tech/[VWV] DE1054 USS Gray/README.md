The USS Gray is a ship of the Knox class destroyer escorts, in this mod in a circa 1973 version. It is a variant with a SAM battery at the aft. Due to the Army abandoned joint developed plan for point defense missile system, the Navy hastily developed a point-defense missile system that requires manual aiming. That became the Basic point defense missile system (BPDMS) and USS Gray / USS Ouellet / USS Trippe enter the Vietnam war with this system.
