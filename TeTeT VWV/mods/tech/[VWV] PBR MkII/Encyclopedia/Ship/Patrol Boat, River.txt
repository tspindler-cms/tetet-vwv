History:

The PBR was developed in 1965 for Operation Game Warden (Task Force 116) to secure South Vietnam's vast network of shallow inland waterways against the Viet Cong.
Designed by Willis Slane and Jack Hargrave of Hatteras Yachts in just seven days after a meeting with the Navy, the PBR was based on an existing pleasure yacht hull.
The first 11 PBRs were delivered in March 1966, followed by approximately 300 units built by Uniflite in Bellingham, Washington, for American and South Vietnamese forces.
The Mark II, an improved version one foot wider than the Mark I, incorporated enhanced drives to reduce fouling and aluminum gunwales to resist wear.
Highly maneuverable and light, the PBR could traverse waters only 2.5 feet deep, but at the expense of substantial armored protection, relying instead on rapid acceleration, maneuverability, and speed.
PBRs patrolled the Mekong Delta, Rung Sat Special Zone, Saigon River, and I Corps to intercept weapons shipments, frequently engaging in close-quarters combat and serving for SEAL team insertions and extractions.
Due to the nature of their mission, Task Force 116 crews experienced some of the highest mortality rates of the war, but were also among the most decorated, including James "Willie" Williams who received the Medal of Honor.
A force of 250 PBRs was deployed in Vietnam, becoming the most common craft in the River Patrol Force until 1975, before being transferred to South Vietnamese, Laotian, Khmer, and Thai forces.
