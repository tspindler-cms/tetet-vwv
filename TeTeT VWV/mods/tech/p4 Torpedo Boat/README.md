# DCS-Ship-mod-Template P 4 class torpedo boat

This branch implements a P 4 class torpedo boat for DCS. It is based on a TurboSquid model, https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/torpedo-boat-p123k-komsomolec-max/809089
Publicly available information on the boat from Wikipedia is used as well: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_4-class_torpedo_boat

Thanks to Joey45 for providing the template and assistance in using it! Thanks to Hawkeye60 for debugging help and ideas on developing the mod!
