The USS Knox is the lead ship of the Knox class destroyer escorts, in this mod in a circa 1972 version. 

Knox's main gun still retains the shape of the cancelled AA gunner position.

Early Knoxs flight deck was mainly used to operate DASH drones. Later they increased the flight deck area a little to accommodate regular helicopter and a retractable hangar was installed for the helicopter, see the DE Kirk classs.
