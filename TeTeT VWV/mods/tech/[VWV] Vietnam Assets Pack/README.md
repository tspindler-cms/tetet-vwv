KNOWN ISSUES
- When transitioning from the standalone Vietnam Asset Pack to [VWV] Vietnam Asset Pack the requiredMods entry in the mission.miz/mission file needs to change:
old: "Vietnam Assets Pack by EightBall & Tobi"
new: "[VWV] Vietnam Assets Pack"
We have a home grown command line tool for this conversion, will be available in a separate download.
