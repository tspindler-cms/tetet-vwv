This mod is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license, see LICENSE.md for details

The model has been provided by Riko and is being imported into DCS by TeTeT and James J Jackson.

Valuable input during testing is provided by James J Jackson, mrflyboy, winters and Slapshot.

Thanks to Joey45 for additional advice!

While carrying the VWV Vietnam War Vessels short, it will be published outside of the main mod as the model is too modern (post year 2000).
