History:

The CCB served as flagship for river squadron and division commanders as well as command post for Army battalions within the Mobile Riverine Force.
Similar to the Monitor, it was distinguished by its sophisticated communications center installed amidships in place of the standard 81mm mortar.
The CCB acted as a central tactical control hub, enabling commanders to coordinate the entire convoy and maintain communications with ground, air, and naval units.
Its radar and radio equipment allowed it to receive up-to-date mission information from IV Corps and transmit it to all MRF squadron boats while receiving terrain and combat reports from the flotilla.
By the end of 1967, each river assault squadron included 2 CCBs among its assets, operating throughout the 15,000 square miles of the Mekong Delta.
CCBs were transferred to South Vietnamese forces toward the end of American involvement as part of the Vietnamization program.
The only known surviving CCB, CCB-18, is on display at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, California.
