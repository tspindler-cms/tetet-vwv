History:

The ATC(H) was a specialized variant of the Armored Troop Carrier used by the Mobile Riverine Force in Vietnam.
Nicknamed "the world's smallest aircraft carrier," the ATC(H) was distinguished by its steel helicopter platform that replaced the vinyl deck cover of early ATCs.
This modification allowed UH-1D "Huey" helicopters to land directly on the craft for rapid medical evacuation of wounded during riverine operations in the Mekong Delta.
Some units also served as forward aid stations. Helicopter platform conversions were primarily performed at Dong Tam and equipped the newer River Assault Divisions (RivDiv 13 and 15).
These craft operated throughout the 3,000 kilometers of navigable waterways in the Mekong Delta between 1967 and 1970, before being transferred to the South Vietnamese Navy as part of the Vietnamization program.
