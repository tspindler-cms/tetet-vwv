History:

USS Fletcher DD-445 was the lead ship of the most prolific destroyer class in U.S. Navy history, named in honor of Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher, Medal of Honor recipient for his leadership during the Mexican-American War.
Launched on May 3, 1942, by Federal Shipbuilding & Drydock Company in Kearny, New Jersey, and sponsored by Mrs. F.F. Fletcher, the admiral's widow, Fletcher was commissioned on June 30, 1942, under the command of Lieutenant Commander W.M. Cole.
Arriving at Noumea, New Caledonia, on October 5, 1942, Fletcher immediately began escort and patrol duties in the Guadalcanal operation, bombarding Lunga Point on October 30.
On November 13, 1942, during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, Fletcher played a crucial role by firing guns and torpedoes in the general melee that sank two Japanese destroyers and damaged battleship Hiei, later sent to the bottom by aviation.
Nicknamed "Lucky 13" after emerging undamaged from the "Friday the 13th" November battle where she was the 13th ship in line in Task Force 67, Fletcher became famous for the CIC (Combat Information Center) innovation, a major contribution by Commander Cole and exec Wylie that revolutionized naval combat operations.
On November 30, 1942, Fletcher led her force through Lengo Channel and made the first radar contact with the enemy off Tassafaronga Point just before midnight, participating in a battle that saw one Japanese destroyer sunk but four American cruisers heavily damaged.
Fletcher rescued survivors of Northampton (CA-26) by ingeniously using cork-floated cargo nets to recover large groups of men from the water, then continued operating in the Solomons: patrols, coastal bombardments, destruction of Japanese barges, rescue of downed aviators, and coverage of new landings.
On February 11, 1943, alerted by a smoke float dropped by an aircraft from Helena (CL-50), Fletcher attacked and sank a Japanese submarine, one of 29 submarine victories by the Fletcher class during the war.
Between April and May 1943, Fletcher stayed in Sydney, Australia, for a well-earned rest before resuming a month of general duty in the Solomons, then participated in Gilbert Islands operations (November 1943), repelling a Japanese air counterattack on November 26, and the Marshall Islands campaign (1944).
In October 1944, Fletcher participated in the Philippine liberation, supporting the Lingayen Gulf landings in January 1945, and on February 14, 1945, suffered casualties during the Corregidor operation where Water Tender Second Class Elmer Charles Bigelow was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his combat heroism.
Decommissioned on January 15, 1947, after receiving 15 battle stars for World War II (a number surpassed by few other ships), Fletcher was recommissioned on October 3, 1949, as an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) specialist and reclassified DDE-445.
During the Korean War, Fletcher provided gunfire support during the Inchon invasion in September 1950 and returned a year later to again provide support, receiving 5 additional battle stars for this conflict.
Reclassified DD-445 in June 1962, Fletcher made four six-month deployments to Vietnam between 1965 and 1969, performing various missions: naval gunfire support for troops ashore, aircraft carrier plane guard duty, coastal shipping interdiction, and picket duty near the North Vietnamese coast.
In August 1968, in a historic event, Fletcher and USS Philip (DD-498) swapped crews to allow Philip's trained crew to continue a scheduled deployment after their ship was found unfit for service, resulting in Fletcher's final deployment just three months after returning from the previous one.
Decommissioned on August 1, 1969, in San Diego and stricken the same day after 27 years of honorable service, Fletcher, despite her status as class lead ship and exceptional record, was not preserved as a museum ship; sold for scrap in February 1972 for $103,500 to Tai Kien Industries Co. of Taiwan, she was towed by a Japanese tug to her final destination, an unworthy end for a three-war veteran who had forged her class's legend.
