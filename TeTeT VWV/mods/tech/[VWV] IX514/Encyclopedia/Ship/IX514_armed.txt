The Helicopter Landing Trainer (HLT), IX-514, began operations in April 1986 
as a cost-effective training vessel, greatly needed to provide student Naval 
Aviators with underway single-spot deck landing qualifications. 
The HLT relieved the USS LEXINGTON (AVT-16) of rotary-wing training requirements 
and provided a realistic training environment. 

All helicopter pilots are familiar with the flatbed truck of a landing surface 
known as IX-514. This less-than-formidable, deck-landing trainer patrolled 
the calm waters of Santa Rosa Bay and offered aspiring aviators their first 
taste of a landing surface that wasn't stationary. 

IX-514 set a new single-day record on 10 June 1988 with 346 landings. 
Since being assigned to NAS Pensacola, Fla., in 1986, 
the 131-foot Vietnam-era yard freight utility craft had completed 
64,159 mishap-free helicopter landings. Civilian contractor Seaward Services, 
Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Fla., took over operations of 
the helicopter landing trainer IX-514 at NAS Pensacola, Fla., on 17 December 2000.
