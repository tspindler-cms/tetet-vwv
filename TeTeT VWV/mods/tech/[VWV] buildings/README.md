This mod is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license, see LICENSE.md for details.

The models in this mod have been sources from multiple locations.

In general the models were modified by Odyseus to fit into DCS, and rigged by TeTeT.
The Indohuts were created by Pirat3n.

The armed Guard Tower needs the AK-47n weapon from the Vietnam Asset Pack (VAP), see
https://github.com/tobi-be/DCS-OH-6A/releases for download options.

The only model with a destruct option is the Guard Tower currently.

The content specifically is:
Guard Tower - can be used by either side, probably more appropriate for VC and NVA
Guard Tower, armed - meant for VC side and equipped by 4 AK-47s that need VAP
Indochina Huts - two huts from the 1950ies time period
US Barbed Wire - razorwire to be deployed around bases, comes in 3 lengths
US Barracks - hootches for the troops
US Barrels - six different barrels for use at a base as decoration
US Boomgate - deny or grant access to a base, has a custom arg to open and close the boom
US Conex - a sling loadable container (in Cargos) or default structure
US Guardhouse - a shed for a guard
US Hangar - hardened aircraft shelter
US Marsdenmat - steel mat for placing heavy equipment such as aircraft on them, in structures and also available as FARP
US Revetments - earth filled barrier to be placed for protection
US Watchtower - a lookout post for a camp

This part of the mod is still under (heavy) development.

KNOWN ISSUES
- Armed Guard Tower - if you place a aircraft close to it, it will ignore ground targets and engage the aircraft
- no destruct model - only the Guard Tower has one
