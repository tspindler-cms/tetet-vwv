The Lockheed L-1049G Super Constellation, popularly known as the "Super G," is a four-engine, pressurized piston-driven airliner that represents the pinnacle of the Constellation design lineage. entering service in 1954, it was the most successful variant of the Super Constellation series, renowned for its distinctive triple-tail design and dolphin-shaped fuselage. Powered by four Wright R-3350 Turbo-Compound engines and typically equipped with wingtip fuel tanks for extended range, the Super G was capable of flying transatlantic routes non-stop with up to 99 passengers in a pressurized, luxury cabin. Over 100 L-1049Gs were built, serving major carriers like TWA, Air France, and Lufthansa before the jet age rendered them obsolete.
