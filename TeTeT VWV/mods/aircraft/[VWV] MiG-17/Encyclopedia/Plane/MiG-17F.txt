The MiG-17F is a high-subsonic, swept-wing day fighter developed by the Soviet Union as a refined evolution of the famous MiG-15. Distinguished by its more sharply swept wing (45 degrees), longer fuselage, and the introduction of the VK-1F afterburning engine, the "Fresco-C" remedied the high-speed instability issues of its predecessor. Despite lacking sophisticated radar or missiles, the MiG-17F became a feared adversary over Vietnam; its tight turning radius and heavy cannon armament allowed skilled North Vietnamese pilots to lure heavier, faster American fighters into low-speed "knife fights" where the MiG's superior maneuverability could be decisively exploited.
