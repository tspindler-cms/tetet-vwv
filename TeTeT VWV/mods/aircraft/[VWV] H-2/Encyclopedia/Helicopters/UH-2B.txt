The UH-2B Seasprite is a simplified, lightweight variant of the A-model produced concurrently for the US Navy. To reduce cost and weight for clear-weather logistics missions, the UH-2B was delivered without the sophisticated automatic stabilization equipment (ASE) and navigational avionics found in the UH-2A, limiting it strictly to Visual Flight Rules (VFR) operations. Although visually identical to the 'A' model externally, the lack of IFR instrumentation relegated the 'B' model primarily to daylight utility transport and courier duties between ships until nearly all were eventually upgraded to twin-engine standards.
