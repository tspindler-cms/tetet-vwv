The UH-2A Seasprite is a single-engine, all-weather utility helicopter developed by Kaman Aircraft for the United States Navy, entering service in 1962. Designed to replace the piston-engined H-25 Mule, it features Kaman's unique "servo-flap" control system, where small ailerons on the rotor blades control the pitch, eliminating the complex hydraulics of conventional swashplates. While agile and fast, the single-engine configuration proved hazardous for overwater operations, and the avionics suite provided full Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) capability, allowing it to perform "plane guard" duties for aircraft carriers in poor weather conditions.
