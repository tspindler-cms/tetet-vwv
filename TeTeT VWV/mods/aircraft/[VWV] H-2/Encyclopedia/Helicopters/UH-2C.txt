The UH-2C Seasprite is a twin-engine conversion of existing UH-2A and UH-2B airframes, initiated in 1966 to address the safety concerns of single-engine operation in the maritime environment. By mounting two T58 engines in distinct external pods on either side of the transmission housing, the UH-2C gained true engine redundancy, significantly increasing safety during hover and rescue hoist operations. This modification, often referred to as the "H-2 Tomahawk" during development, doubled the horsepower but slightly reduced range due to higher fuel consumption; it served heavily in the Vietnam theater as the Navy's primary Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) platform "SAR Clementine."
