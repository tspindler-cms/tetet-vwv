The SH-2F Seasprite is the definitive "Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System" (LAMPS Mk I) variant, extensively remanufactured from earlier models to provide destroyers and frigates with over-the-horizon detection and attack capabilities. Identified by its chin-mounted radar radome, towed Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) on the starboard fuselage, and upgraded "101" high-performance rotor system, the SH-2F extended the sensor range of its parent ship. Serving well into the 1990s (including service during Operation Desert Storm), the SH-2F utilized a tactical data link to relay radar and acoustic information back to the ship's Combat Information Center, acting as the fleet's primary small-deck ASW asset before the arrival of the SH-60 Seahawk.
