The CH-46D Sea Knight, affectionately known as the "Phrog," is a tandem-rotor, twin-engine medium-lift helicopter developed by the Boeing Vertol Company for the United States Navy and Marine Corps. Entering service in the mid-1960s as a more powerful successor to the A-model, the CH-46D became the workhorse of vertical replenishment (VERTREP) and assault transport missions during the Vietnam War. Its distinct tandem-rotor configuration eliminates the need for a tail rotor, allowing 100% of engine power to generate lift and providing exceptional stability in strong crosswinds. Over 260 D-models were procured, serving a vital role in ship-to-shore logistics and medical evacuation until eventually being supplanted by the CH-46E and later the MV-22 Osprey.

Note: Unlike conventional single-rotor helicopters, the CH-46D does not suffer from "loss of tail rotor effectiveness" (LTE) and possesses a generous center of gravity range, making it easier to load unevenly. However, the aircraft is aerodynamically limited by the interaction between the forward and aft rotor wash; high-speed forward flight can induce severe vibration and retreating blade stall on the rear rotor, requiring pilots to carefully manage collective pitch and airspeed during aggressive maneuvering.
