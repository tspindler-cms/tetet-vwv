The Tiny Tim is a massive, unguided air-to-ground rocket developed by the United States Navy and Caltech during the final stages of World War II to provide carrier aircraft with the punching power of a naval destroyer's main guns. Designed to destroy heavy shipping and reinforced bunkers, the rocket consisted of a 500-pound semi-armor-piercing bomb welded to a 11.75-inch diameter steel motor casing containing four solid propellant grains. Because the immense blast of its 30,000-pound thrust motor could damage the launching aircraft, the Tiny Tim utilized a unique "gravity-drop" ignition system: the rocket was released like a bomb, and a lanyard attached to the pylon ignited the motor only after the weapon had fallen safely clear of the propeller arc. It saw combat during the Battle of Okinawa and the Korean War, proving capable of penetrating reinforced concrete and ship hulls.
