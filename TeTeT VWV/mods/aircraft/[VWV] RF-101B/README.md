Modified for the VWV mod by TeTeT and Odyseus.

Provides an AI RF-101B for the US Air Force.

The RF-101B Voodoo is a late two seater variant of the Voodoo. It actually never was used for recon in South East Asia, unlike it's single seater companion RF-101C Voodoo. However, we decided to put this plane into the mod to attribute for the Voodoo presence in the early war years in Vietnam.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
  - The landing gear doors and covers don't close perfectly
  - The landing gear suspension is not animated
  - The BORT number should be five digits, not three
  - The pilot is generic rather than specific for the Voodoo. Development of a custom Voodoo pilot is out of financial reach, if interested in sponsoring one contact TeTeT
  - There are no pylons present currently, not even for fuel tanks
