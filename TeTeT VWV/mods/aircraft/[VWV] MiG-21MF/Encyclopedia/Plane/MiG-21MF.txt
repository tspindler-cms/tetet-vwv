The MiG-21MF represents the "third generation" of the legendary Fishbed series, evolving the platform from a specialized, short-range interceptor into a more capable multi-role fighter. Characterized by its large dorsal spine—which housed additional fuel and avionics—and the more powerful R-13 engine, the "MF" addressed the critical lack of an internal gun found in earlier "P" variants. While it retained the delta-wing’s superb high-speed performance and climb rate, the MF introduced the RP-22 Sapfir-21 radar and doubled the missile capacity to four pylons. In the final stages of the Vietnam War and later Cold War conflicts, the MiG-21MF proved to be a lethal energy fighter; though it lacked the high-alpha maneuverability of the MiG-17, its blistering acceleration and "hit-and-run" capability made it a supreme interceptor against the F-4 Phantom and F-105 Thunderchief.
