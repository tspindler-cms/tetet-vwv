Mig-17f Liveries for CV-31 USS Bon Homme Richard Mod

Work in Progress Liveries (if you care, roughmet files need more work)

These do not over write the original liveries in the mod.  To distinguish original liveries and the new liveries look for the livery 
an aircraft number in the drop down selection in mission editor.

Thanks to:

Hawkeye for the mod
Hawkeye for the updates, tweaks, and additional mods
Pedro Caparros for the orignial mod and livery
TeTeT for the USS Bon Homme Richard mod which started all this
TeTeT, Toan, Citizen and Spino for the ideas, codes, textures

To those I missed, my sincere apologies and a big Mahalo!
