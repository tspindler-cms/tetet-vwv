The Cessna O-1 Bird Dog (originally designated L-19) was the backbone of US Forward Air Control (FAC) operations during the early years of the Vietnam War. Derived from the civilian Cessna 170, the Bird Dog was modified with a cut-down rear fuselage and "Omni-View" canopy to provide exceptional visibility for artillery spotting and target marking. Renowned for its ruggedness and Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) capabilities, the O-1 could operate from rough, improvised jungle strips. Its pilots, often flying "low and slow" to draw enemy fire, would mark targets with White Phosphorus (Willie Pete) rockets to direct airstrikes from heavier fighter-bombers.
