The Cessna A-37B Dragonfly, often called the "Super Tweet," is a light attack aircraft developed from the T-37 primary trainer to meet the US Air Force's requirement for a dedicated Counter-Insurgency (COIN) platform during the Vietnam War. While it retained the side-by-side seating and friendly handling of the trainer, the A-37B was structurally reinforced and fitted with engines producing nearly three times the thrust of the original. Known for its ability to operate from short, unimproved airstrips and its legendary bombing accuracy, the Dragonfly served extensively with the USAF and South Vietnamese Air Force (VNAF), often flying missions too low and slow for faster jets like the F-4 or F-105.
